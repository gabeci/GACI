# GACI MVP v0.1.3

Emotion → Meaning → Alignment Action (Together is strictly optional)

## Run locally

- npm install
- npm run dev

## What this includes

A web-first MVP scaffold with 4 Instagram-like bottom tabs:
1. Journal
2. Chatbot
3. Together
4. Constellation

Hard rules:
- Core loop: Emotion Capture → Meaning Convergence → Alignment Action
- One action only per session
- Result output must be exactly 3 lines: Meaning / Alignment Action / Why
- Together is strictly optional (no coercion)
- Default visibility is private

`/spec` is the source of truth for product rules, contract stubs, and labels/resources.
