# Project North Star
- Core loop: Emotion Capture → Meaning Convergence → Alignment Action.
- Emotion = felt state label.
- Meaning = converged interpretation of the state.
- Alignment Action = exactly one next action for the session.

# Non-negotiables
- No coercion Together: no onboarding gate, no completion gate, no post-checkin DM push.
- 3-line locked result only: Meaning / Alignment Action / Why.
- One action per session (never multiple action outputs).
- Default visibility is private.

# Commands
- npm install
- npm run dev
- npm run build
- npm run lint

# Repo structure
- `/spec` is source of truth.
- UI must keep bottom tabs + tab screens (`/journal`, `/chatbot`, `/together`, `/constellation`).
