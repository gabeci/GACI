# GACI MVP v0.1.3 — PRD (Source of Truth)

## Core Loop (must be self-contained)
Emotion Capture → Meaning Convergence → Alignment Action
- Exactly ONE Alignment Action per session.
- Output is locked to exactly 3 lines:
  1) Meaning
  2) Alignment Action
  3) Why this helps (alignment perspective)

## Together is Optional (Non-coercion policy)
- Together (Feed/Story/DM) is an optional layer.
- Never gate core loop completion behind Together.
- No onboarding step requires Together.
- No post-checkin UI pushes DM or connection.
- Only allow entry when the user taps the Together tab or explicitly taps a tiny “Connect (Optional)” link.

## Navigation (Instagram-like)
Bottom tabs (fixed order):
1) Journal
2) Chatbot
3) Together
4) Constellation

## MVP Screens (Ticket 1 placeholder)
- Journal: Instagram-like feed placeholder
- Chatbot: DM-like placeholder
- Together: Feed/Story/DM segmented placeholder
- Constellation: Graph placeholder

## Privacy default
- Default visibility is private.
